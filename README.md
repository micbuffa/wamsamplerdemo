# `sampler`

How to lanch the sampler ?

First of all you have to follow the README in the "WAM-Sampler" folder to install the project properly.

Then, I personally use Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension.
It allows you to launch the sampler and see your changes in the code in real time.

All you have to do is to open the index.html file in the code and press the "Go live" button in the bottom right of VSCode.
It will open the sampler in your default browser, i personally use Google Chrome but it should work on any browser.

If you use any other stuff to open your html code in your browser, give it a try, it might work properly.



Check http://www.freesound.org/docs/api/ for documentation about the API.
Apply for an API key at http://www.freesound.org/api/apply/
Enter your key in the sampler interface on your browser in order to use the sound explorer.# wamsamplerdemo
